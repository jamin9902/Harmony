Welcome to Harmony, the social media website for musicians!

To configure this application, you will need to set UPLOAD_FOLDER on line 26 of application.py to the path of harmony/audio inside of your directory. To start running the website, type “cd harmony” and then “flask run” and click on the link. 

Once you have clicked said link you will be directed to the login page for Harmony! First register as a user by giving a unique username and a password with confirmation. Next, you will be redirected to an information page to fill out your bio and musical genres of interest. You may revisit this page at any point by clicking “Profile” and then “Edit Profile” to change your profile. After filling out this form you will be directed to your profile page which can be accessed anytime by clicking “Profile” in the navigation bar. On this page, you will notice “Create Post”. This button allows you to create a post in which you will upload an audio file (.mp3 or .wav) with an optional caption. Once posted, this post will be visible on your profile and can be see by other users through your profile or their homepage. 

Using the search bar, you may look for other users. The search bar in the top right will yield all users whose name matches your search and will allow you to view their profiles. When viewing another user’s profile, you may follow them, which will allow you to message them and see their posts, which will be displayed upon following them.

Your homepage displays all posts from users you follow in chronological order and can be found by using the “Harmony” logo or music note icon in the top left corner. You can listen to these posts by pressing the play button on the audio portion of each post. You may play and download all posts.

In the navigation bar “Messages” redirects you to the messages page, which allows you to communicate with other users. You can send a new message to any user you are following through “New Message +”.  Any pre-existing conversations with users will have their own navigation buttons below “New Message +”. When any one of these buttons is clicked, a new page chat page will appear so that you may communicate with the selected user. Messages will automatically update when you send them but not when another user sends one to you.

You may log out of your account by clicking “Log Out” in the top right corner.

Enjoy!
